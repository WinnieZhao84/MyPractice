/**
 * Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array": What if duplicates are allowed?
 *
 * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 *
 * (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 * Find the minimum element. The array may contain duplicates.
