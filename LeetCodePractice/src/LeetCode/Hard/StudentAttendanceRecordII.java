/**
 * Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable.
 * The answer may be very large, return it after mod 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following three characters:
 * 'A' : Absent.
 * 'L' : Late.
 * 'P' : Present.
 *
 * A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 8
 *
 * Explanation:
 * There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
 * "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
 * Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times.
