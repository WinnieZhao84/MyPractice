/**
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
 * Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
 *
 * Note: A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
 * Return 3.
 * The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

     * The merge sort based solution counts the answer while doing the merge. During the merge stage,
     * we have already sorted the left half [start, mid) and right half [mid, end). We then iterate
     * through the left half with index i. For each i, we need to find two indices k and j in the right half where
     *
     * j is the first index satisfy sums[j] - sums[i] > upper and
     * k is the first index satisfy sums[k] - sums[i] >= lower.
     *
     * Then the number of sums in [lower, upper] is j-k. We also use another index t to copy the elements satisfy
     * sums[t] < sums[i] to a cache in order to complete the merge sort.
     *
     * Despite the nested loops, the time complexity of the "merge & count" stage is still linear.
     * Because the indices k, j, t will only increase but not decrease, each of them will only traversal the right half once at most.
     * The total time complexity of this divide and conquer solution is then O(n log n).
