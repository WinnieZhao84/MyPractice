/**
 * Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land)
 * connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid
 * are surrounded by water.
 *
 * Count the number of distinct islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape,
 * or have the same shape after rotation (90, 180, or 270 degrees only) or reflection (left/right direction or up/down direction).
 *
 * Example 1:
 * 11000
 * 10000
 * 00001
 * 00011
 * Given the above grid map, return 1.
 *
 * Notice that:
 * 11
 * 1
 *
 * and
 * 1
 * 11
 *
 * are considered same island shapes. Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise rotation on the first island,
 * then two islands will have the same shapes.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * 11100
 * 10001
 * 01001
 * 01110
 *
 * Given the above grid map, return 2.
 *
 * Here are the two distinct islands:
 * 111
 * 1
 * and
 * 1
 * 1
 *
 * Notice that:
 * 111
 * 1
 * and
 * 1
 * 111
 *
 * are considered same island shapes. Because if we flip the first array in the up/down direction,
 * then they have the same shapes.
 * Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.

public class NumberOfDistinctIslandsII {

    /**
     * As in Approach #1 to the sister problem Number of Distinct Islands, we determine local coordinates for each island.
     * Afterwards, we will rotate and reflect the coordinates about the origin and translate the shape so that the bottom-left-most
     * coordinate is (0, 0). At the end, the smallest of these lists coordinates will be the canonical representation of the shape.
     *
     * Algorithm
     * We feature two different implementations, but the core idea is the same. We start with the code from the previous problem,
     * Number of Distinct Islands.
     *
     * For each of 8 possible rotations and reflections of the shape, we will perform the transformation and then translate
     * the shape so that the bottom-left-most coordinate is (0, 0). Afterwards, we will consider the canonical hash of the
     * shape to be the maximum of these 8 intermediate hashes.
     *
     * In Java, we manipulate the coordinates directly. The 8 rotations and reflections of each point are
     * (x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (-x, -y), (y, x), (-y, x), (y, -x), (-y, -x).
