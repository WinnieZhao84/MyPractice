/**
 * You are writing a simulation for a print server. This print server can accept jobs from 3 places -
 * network, USB, or operator. It can dispatch only one job at a time. Each input job should contain an
 * integer t which is the time in seconds it will take to process the job.
 * Write a multi-threaded program to simulate the server and provide some simulated load with jobs.
 * Think, of some interesting statistics your program should emit and code them in
