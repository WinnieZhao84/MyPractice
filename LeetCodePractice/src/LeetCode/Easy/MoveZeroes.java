     * The total number of operations of the previous approach is sub-optimal.
     * For example, the array which has all (except last) leading zeroes: [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1].
     * How many write operations to the array? For the previous approach, it writes 0's n-1nâˆ’1 times,
     * which is not necessary. We could have instead written just once.
     * How? ..... By only fixing the non-0 element,i.e., 1.
     *
     * The optimal approach is again a subtle extension of above solution. A simple realization is
     * if the current element is non-0, its' correct position can at best be it's current position or a position earlier.
     * If it's the latter one, the current position will be eventually occupied by a non-0 ,or a 0,
     * which lies at a index greater than 'cur' index. We fill the current position by 0 right away,
     * so that unlike the previous solution, we don't need to come back here in next iteration.
     *
     * In other words, the code will maintain the following invariant:
     * All elements before the slow pointer (lastNonZeroFoundAt) are non-zeroes.
     * All elements between the current and slow pointer are zeroes.
     * Therefore, when we encounter a non-zero element, we need to swap elements pointed by current and slow pointer,
     * then advance both pointers. If it's zero element, we just advance current pointer.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n).
     * However, the total number of operations are optimal. The total operations (array writes) that code does is Number
     * of non-0 elements.This gives us a much better best-case (when most of the elements are 0) complexity than last
     * solution. However, the worst-case (when all elements are non-0) complexity for both the algorithms is same.
